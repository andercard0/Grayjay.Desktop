# Grayjay Desktop
Grayjay is a multi-platform media application that allows you to watch content from multiple platforms in a single application. Using an extendable plugin system developers can make new integrations with additional platforms. Plugins are cross-compatible between Android and Desktop.

FUTO is an organization dedicated to developing, both through in-house engineering and investment, technologies that frustrate centralization and industry consolidation.

For more elaborate showcase of features and downloads, check out the website.

Here is an example of what the video player looks like, we support various views so that you can view the video how you like. By default we show a theater view that becomes smaller when reading comments, while not entirely hiding it.
